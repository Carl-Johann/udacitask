1# feature: 	
todolist:15 I have added a feature which will clear the whole list.

2# feature: 
todolist:20 I have a feature which will check if the due date is overdue, and change @completed_status to 'OVERDUE'. At the moment it's a bit artificial, i know, but with very few changes like: 
    At todolist:7 i could change the line to: @time_today = Time.now
  but for the sake of getting a correct output, and making sure it works even i you were reviewing my code the following month, it is what it is.

3# feature: 
todolist:52 I made a method that checks if the @items array is empty. If it is, it will puts one thing, and another if it isn't.
